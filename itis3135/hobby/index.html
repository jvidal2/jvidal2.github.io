        <section id="about">
            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Iâ€™ve enjoyed playing video games since childhood, starting 
                with my VTech tablet and evolving through consoles and PCs. My love for 
                gaming really took off in middle school, and Iâ€™ve since developed a liking for 
                open-world, FPS, and co-op games. Some of my current favorites are Fortnite, 
                GTA, Minecraft, and Detroit: Become Human. I love gaming because it allows me to 
                unwind and have fun with my friends without taking things too seriously. For me, 
                gaming is a way to escape reality and connect with others.</p>
            <p>One of the things I love most about gaming is the feeling of escaping reality and 
                entering a completely different world. Whether it's exploring open landscapes, 
                completing intense missions, defeating all other players, or simply unwinding after 
                a long day. In those moments, all stress and worry fades away, and Iâ€™m fully immersed 
                in the characters, stories, and challenges that these games create. Itâ€™s an adventure 
                every time whether Iâ€™m saving the world, building my own, or just teaming up with 
                friends for some fun.</p>

            <h2>Best Games</h2>
            <p>Over the years, Iâ€™ve played a lot of games, but a few stand out as my absolute favorites. 
                These are the ones that keep me coming back for more, whether itâ€™s the thrill of competition, 
                the freedom to explore, or the chance to connect with friends.</p>
            <ul> 
                <li><b>Fortnite:</b> I have been playing this game for years now. I love the fast-paced action, the 
                    silly glitches, and the new skins and emotes. Whether Iâ€™m playing solo or teaming up with 
                    friends, itâ€™s always a new experience.</li>
                <li><b>Grand Theft Auto V:</b> GTA offers an open-world experience like no other. The freedom to explore, 
                    complete missions, or just cause chaos in the streets makes it a game that never gets old. The 
                    storytelling and detailed world-building keep me hooked every time.</li>
                <li><b>Minecraft:</b> Minecraft is my go to for creativity and relaxation. Building, exploring, and surviving 
                    in a limitless blocky world lets me tap into my imagination, whether Iâ€™m crafting elaborate structures or 
                    just enjoying the simple pleasures of exploration.</li>
                <li><b>Detroit: Become Human:</b> Detroit: Become Human is a game that stands out for its emotional storytelling 
                    and immersive decision-making. Every choice I make has a direct impact on the story, which makes each playthrough 
                    feel unique and personal. Itâ€™s like being in control of an interactive movie.</li>
                <li><b>Phasmophobia:</b> Phasmophobia is a fun co-op game where I team up with friends to hunt ghosts 
                    and uncover their mysteries. The tension and thrill of investigating haunted locations, combined with the 
                    eerie atmosphere, create unforgettable moments. It's a perfect blend of teamwork, strategy, and a good scare!</li>

        <section id="how">
            <h2>How to Choose Your Platform</h2>
            <p>Here are 5 things to consider when choosing a gaming platform:</p>
            <h3>Different Platforms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Console Gaming:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Popular brands:</strong> PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy setup, exclusive games, optimized for gaming.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited customization and hardware upgrades.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>PC Gaming:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can be customizable or prebuilt.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Higher graphics quality, upgradeable components, a wider range of games, and access to mods.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Higher initial setup cost, requires regular updates/upgrades.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mobile Gaming:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can game on smartphones or tablets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Convenience, portability, often cheaper or free games.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited in game complexity and control options.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Consider What Games You Want to Play</h3>
            <p>Some games are exclusive to certain platforms, while others are multiplatform. Consider which games you enjoy and if they are available 
                on the platform you're choosing.</p>
            <h3>Budget</h3>
            <p>Consoles are generally affordable upfront, while PC gaming can be more expensive. Mobile gaming is often the cheapest option since most 
                people already own a smartphone.</p>
            <h3>Portability</h3>
            <p>If you want to game on the go, consider platforms like the Nintendo Switch or mobile gaming. PCs and other consoles are typically stationary, 
                though gaming laptops offer some portability.</p>
            <h3>Assess Your Tech Savvy</h3>
            <p>PC gaming requires more technical knowledge for setup and maintenance, while consoles and mobile devices offer simpler, plug-and-play options 
                for casual gamers.</p>

        <section id="why">
            <h2>Why game?</h2>
            <p>People play video games for many reasons, ranging from escaping their everyday lives to entertainment. Games offer a break from reality, allowing players to dive 
            into new worlds and forget about everyday stresses. They also encourage creativity and exploration, with games like Minecraft and GTA letting 
            players build, design, and discover freely. Gaming is a social activity as well, giving people the chance to connect with friends or meet new 
            people through multiplayer experiences. For many, the challenge of overcoming obstacles and improving their skills is a rewarding aspect, while 
            at the heart of it, gaming is about having fun and enjoying the thrill of the experience.</p>
