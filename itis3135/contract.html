            <h2>Contract</h2>
            <p>I, <a href="index.html">Jazmin Vidal</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2024, ITIS3135, Web App Design and Development  with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.<br>

                I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.<br>
                
                I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.<br>
                
                I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.<br>
                
                Signed: <i>Jazmin Vidal</i>, 09/11/2024 </p>
