                    <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple's Website</a>
                </h3>
                <p>The Apple website showcases the company's latest products, including iPhones,
                    iPads, and MacBooks, in a sleek, modern design. It emphasizes visual appeal
                    and user experience with a clean layout, easy navigation, and high-quality product
                    images. The website is designed to make shopping for Apple products intuitive,
                    offering detailed product pages and an efficient checkout process.

                    <li>
                        <b>Contrast:</b> Apple uses high contrast effectively, with bold typography 
                        against clean white backgrounds. This helps important information stand out clearly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Repetition:</b> Consistent design elements, such as font styles, color
                        schemes, and button designs, are used throughout the site. The product pages
                        all have a similar layout and structure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Alignment:</b> Every element on the Apple website is carefully aligned, 
                        whether it's images, text, or buttons. This alignment helps maintain a clean
                        and organized layout that's easy to navigate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Proximity:</b> Related content, such as product images and descriptions, 
                        are placed close together. This grouping makes it easy for users to find and 
                        understand the information they need quickly.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Ling's Cars is a car leasing website that stands out with its extremely unconventional 
                    and chaotic design. It features bright colors, flashy graphics, and overwhelming amounts 
                    of information scattered acorss the page. While it's intended to be quirky and playful, 
                    the cluttered layout and excessive animations can make it difficult for users to naviagte 
                    and focus on the important details.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Contrast:</b> While the website uses contrasting colors, the excessive use of bright 
                        and clashing hues makes it visually overwhelming. Instead of helping important information 
                        stand out, the contrast creates a sense of chaos.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Repetition:</b> The design lacks consistent repetition of elements like fonts, colors, 
                        and layout styles. Each section feels disconnected, with no clear design language tying the 
                        pages together, making the user experience disjointed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Alignment:</b> There is little to no alignment on the Ling's Cars website. Elements are 
                        scattered randomly across the page, making it difficult for users to find information in a 
                        structured manner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Proximity:</b> Related content is often spaced too far apart or surrounded by unrelated 
                        elements. This poor proximity confuses the user, as it's hard to tell which pieces of information
                        belong together.
